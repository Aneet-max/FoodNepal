    <string name="about_us">Food and internet have been the most 
important aspects lately, while merging these two basic fundamentals what we can
 expect is a review application that allows us to know if a restaurant offers proper
 food or not which is based on the review of fellow food enthusiasts and application users.
 Food Nepal will help to avoid the situations where our expectations for a restaurant is hoping 
its nice but turns out exactly opposite. When a nearby restaurant is shown, users can also see 
some details regarding the restaurant along with the name and exact location.
we would like to hear every good and bad comments,please feel free to contact us. 
submit your queries through the feedback submission page.\n\n
